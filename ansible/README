Ansible templates for hosts config automation
*********************************************

Inventory note:
Hostnames in inventory files must be very descriptive and specific because:
  1. The ansible.cfg file sets the default inventory path to ./inventory
  2. the files ./inventory are brooken up into separate files

Therefore, setting a generic or shared hostname n in a playbook might run against other hosts.
