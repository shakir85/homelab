# Only run this Playbook via the script: bootstrap.sh
# This Playbook sets the Ansible user configured in ansible.cfg
# as a remote user using the provided SSH public key.
# This way, the Ansible controller can connect to the managed hosts.
# The bootstrap playbook will initially use a user that already exists on the remote host, provisioned via cloud-init.
