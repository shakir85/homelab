# Attribution & Playbook Overview:
# -----------------
# This playbook and its associated roles are based on the k3s-ansible project,
# which can be found at: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible
# The original project was created by `itwars` and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
#
# Customization Details:
# ----------------------
# In this playbook, I made a modification to the systemd unit file located at:

#
# Modification Purpose:
# ---------------------
# I disabled the built-in load balancer of k3s, allowing me to use MetalLB as an alternative.
